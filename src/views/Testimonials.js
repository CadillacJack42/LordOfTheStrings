          I have taken bass lessons with Gabe for about two years. During that
          time, he taught me how to play bass, the basics of guitar, and, most
          importantly, how to think like a musician.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The area that helped me the most was music theory and how to play with
          anyone. Now, I have the tools to analyze any song I play or write and
          interpret why it may work. I can improve a bass line or be creative
          with the line in clever ways that I would not have thought about
          before. It has made me so much more comfortable jamming with anyone.
          With his lessons, I can get away with playing along to any song.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Gabe can sometimes be a bit serious, but his seriousness made me focus
          much more on any given topic. The pace of the course is up to you, but
          Gabe will push you forward to help you play things you thought were
          above your level.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Overall, Gabe is incredibly knowledgeable and can teach anything from
          the simplest concepts or techniques to something more complicated and
          technical.

          My daughter took guitar classes with Gabe for about 2 years. She made
          a quick progress immediately and ended up playing some amazing pieces.
          The one thing that really struck us was Gabe's ability to teach you
          pretty much anything: any level, any musical style, any random song
          you would come up with he can quickly figure out how to play it and
          what is the best way for you to learn it and adjust it to your level.
          We'd recommend Gabe as a music teacher to anybody!

          As a new beginner to learning the acoustic guitar, Gabriel was a great
          teacher. He was quite passionate about playing the guitar and music in
          general. He was also well experienced and knowledgeable in playing the
          guitar. I was appreciative of his patience when grasping lessons &
          asking questions. I highly recommend.

          I've been working with Gabe for the last four years and I went from
          total beginner at guitar to now being comfortably proficient in
          guitar, bass and the ukulele. Gabe is an awesome teacher and was able
          to present difficult concepts in an easily digestible manner. Whatever
          your music goals are, Gabe can help you meet them! Scheduling is

          Gabe is an awesome teacher! I took bass lessons from him and it was a
          great experience. He has a good way of teaching music concepts and
          will tailor lessons to what you're interested in learning. Also just a

          My daughter's been taking guitar lessons from G for more than 2-3
          years now and she's still thrilled and excited every Tuesday when she
          sets up her electronic guitar and get ready for her lesson. She up to
          challenges in learning new pieces, new tricks or techniques.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          She started with acoustic guitar then gradually moved to electric
          after mastery.
          <br></br>
          Guitar was not her first instrument though, she's taken piano, then
          flute before guitar but she's enjoying guitar better than the previous
          ones. She can just pick it up and roll.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          We're happy with G! He's a good teacher and very patient with the
          lessons and make sure my daughter really knows it before moving to new
          lesson. He definitely knows his forte :)) Highly recommended,

          Back in 2017, I bought my first ever guitar as it was something I
          wanted my entire life. With the wealth of knowledge on the internet, I
          thought I would be able to self teach myself. Two months later, my
          guitar was back to collecting dust.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In 2018, I received a surprise gift for four lessons with a guitar
          instructor nearby, The Lord of the Strings! I was anxious, nervous and
          shy. I couldn't name the strings on my guitar, I knew no chord shapes
          or any music theory at all.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Early on, I made it clear to Gabe what my intentions were with guitar.
          It's a tertiary hobby that I love, but I can't commit an immense
          amount of time to, but I would be attending classes as consistently as
          possible and inform him when I was unable to attend or put in the
          expected time. Some months, I was hyper motivated to learn music and
          guitar theory, others I just brought in riffs or songs that I liked
          and wanted to learn. Gabe continuously supported my approach
          throughout the time.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Since 2018, I have gone to see Gabe pretty much weekly. Given the time
          I've put into the hobby, my skill reflects the effort and Gabe has
          taught me many of my favorite guitar riffs and helped push my
          understanding of music further and further. He has continuously been
          open minded about the music I listen to and am interested in playing
          for fun. If there was ever a part of a song Gabe was unfamiliar with,
          he would spend the time to learn the songs himself and often write out
          the tabs for me based on his ear or analyze how the guitarists perform
          in live videos.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Four years later, I am still excited every week to meet with Gabe and
          spend time on this hobby. I am happy with my skill level in relation
          to the time I've put in and I've gone from someone who didn't know
          anything about the guitar to someone who can play most of their
          favorite riffs for fun and just pick up and play from time to time. I
          wouldn't have gotten to this point without Gabe and I would strongly
          recommend the Lord of the Strings to anyone interested in an attentive
          and motivating guitar instructor.

          My son has been taking weekly guitar lessons with Gabe since January
          2020, and always has postive things to say after every class. I can
          not stress enough how accommodating Gabe is with our schedule. Aside
          from going to school, my son works part-time and it seems like every
          other week, his work schedules him on the same day and time he has
          guitar class. So of course, I'm reaching out to Gabe, apologizing for
          the inconvenience, and requesting to reschedule. And he has had no
          issue rescheduling, everytime!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          What I appreciate the most about Gabe is his knowledge and passion for
          music. Extra points to him for having so much patience with my son,
          who can take a little longer than most, to grasp simple concepts.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I'm hoping that my son continues to be happy playing guitar and I
          would love for him to continue taking lessons with Gabe for as long as
          he wants.

          I've been taking ukulele with Gabe for 5 months and it has been a
          great experience. I came to class the first day having bought my uke
          off amazon not knowing a thing and now I not only can play several
          songs and read tabs But I have a understanding of how to read music. I
          feel that the one on one classes really helped me lear the basics so
          much faster than any teach yourself method. It gave me things to work
          on during the week but also pushed me to learn something new each
          class. Even after just a few classes I was taking my uke to friends
          houses to play songs and everyone was so impressed! I highly recommend
          him for anyone looking to learn the ukulele or guitar.

          I've been taking acoustic guitar lessons with Gabe for just over 8
          months and I couldn't be happier with my progress to date. He's a
          knowledgeable, clear, and patient instructor that I would recommend to
          anyone at any level of skill. I feel like no matter what I want to
          learn or how far I advance, there will still be things I can learn
          from him.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I had previously taught myself guitar ~15 years ago, but had
          hit a ceiling in my progress. I feel like Gabe and I spent the first
          few months reteaching/relearning some bad habits and cheats I had
          taught myself - I believe those habits and cheats actually created the
          ceiling I hit. He helped me lay a new, correct baseline of beginner
          theory that's enabled me to grow and learn so much faster than I could
          have on my own.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          His level of commitment to all areas of music, from theory to
          performance, informs the way he teaches you based on how you learn. If
          I'm not grasping a concept, he covers it multiple ways using different
          examples and tactics - making sure I find a way to latch on and "own"
          the material before moving on.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I appreciate the way he allows his students to shape the
          progress and content of the lessons, if they desire. There's
          definitely structure and paced advancement as you progress, but if I
          show interest in a specific topic, song, or concept, Gabe will make
          room for it in our lessons and my practice. I never feel like we're
          moving too fast or too slow for my skill level - he understands where
          his students are and (I imagine) tailors everything you do/learn to
          the individual.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          He's also a super nice, interesting person who is easy to get along
          with - that's a huge plus when electing to spend time with someone to
          learn something new! 5 stars for Gabe.

          I'm a super beginner guitar player, and since taking lessons with Gabe
          (it's been over a year now) I can honestly say my playing has vastly
          improved! I always come out of every lesson with a bit of knowledge,
          whether theory-based or physical, that helps me grasp something that I
          couldn't before I walked in. Gabe is extremely patient, even when I
          ask the same questions over and over again -- helpful for a shy player

          Gabe is an amazing musician and it shows.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I on the other hand just picked up a guitar to spend sometime
          by myself, in a room, away from work, two crazy little kids and all of
          the other stuff that keeps me from simply relaxing. That worked for a
          few weeks and then I got bored of the books or online videos.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          So I searched around and found Gabe (he had a kick ass deal for the
          first lesson!). The first lessons I assume were the typical lessons
          for someone who didn't even know how to hold a pick. Fingers here,
          look there, this is how you tune and oh hey, it's probably not working
          cause your amp isn't on. Seriously, I had no idea what I was doing.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          It's a year later and I love my guitar more than I ever thought I
          could. I play almost every night and it's not because I'm amazing at
          it but simply because Gabe challenges me. Of course I've improved, but
          more importantly I'm having a great time playing. Sure, the lessons
          are still a bit of work between a teacher and student.....but after
          every lesson I get better and have more fun than before.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          After we got past the basic stuff I began to ask certain questions
          about things. I was curious about: scales, this song or that song,
          Hendrix or The Beatles, etc. etc. Usually it was just curiosity of
          something or maybe a song that I could play if I just learned the
          simple way to play it. But Gabe, in his own very unique way, would
          basically push me to play the song the correct way....showing me piece
          by piece how to play the entire song. Sure, I still think Hendrix and
          John Frusciante are gods among mortals....but I can take a hack at
          some of their songs and have fun doing it!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Let me be clear, Gabe isn't pushy by any means....he sorta just shows
          you that the song you thought was impossible....isn't. And then walks
          you through it until you can pick it all up with the skills (and new
          confidence) he just gave you.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Gabe as a teacher is awesome.....but is seriously impressive as a
          musician. I 've mentioned countless songs to him and he just breaks
          them out without even needing to look at the music or hear the song.
          If he doesn't know the song you're talking about, once he hears it he
          usually can pick it up by ear. And don't even get me started on how
          good his beer brewing skills are!!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          An overall guitar savior for us mere mortals.

          I have had Gabe as a guitar teacher for a number years and I have
          nothing, but absolutely great things to say about him. When I first
          walked into my lesson I had some knowledge of music, but little to no
          knowledge of the guitar. He was and is extremely patient and explains
          everything from basic chords to music theory so anyone can understand.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          He is also willing to teach any song that you are interested in
          playing. If for some reason (and this is very rare) he doesn't know
          the song he will quickly find it and have you playing it by the end of
          the lesson.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I was also amazed that after I had had lessons on the
          acoustic and electric guitar, one day I asked if he'd be willing to
          teach me on the ukulele. He immediately said yes and had me playing
          "Free Falling" by the end of the next lesson.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Lastly, Gabe is also an outstanding guitar player. Occasionally he
          will play something he has written or part of something I haven't
          heard before and its just amazing! I highly recommend him as a
          teacher. You will NOT be disappointed.

          Gabe is an exceptional guitar teacher. He is extremely patient which
          makes the lessons more fun and enjoyable for a beginner guitarist like
          me. At the same time Gabe knows how to push the student outside of
          their comfort zone. With his patience and encouragement I also feel up
          to the challenge without being afraid or embarrassed to make mistakes.
          He has an ability to break down the learning into very small steps and
          come up with drills and exercises to help with technique that I have
          not seen anywhere else. There are some music theory concepts that Gabe
          clearly explained in five minutes that I had never been able to
          understand before. With his instruction I feel that I am developing
          musical sense and ideas that I had not done with other instructors. I
          am very happy with my progress and I look forward to the lessons even
          when I haven't had much chance to practice during the week. I know I
          will learn and progress and have fun doing it.

          I've been fortunate to receive lessons from Gabriel for little over a
          year and half and the very first thing you will notice about his
          teaching methods and what separates him from the vast majority of
          other guitar teachers is that not only will he cater to what you
          specifically are trying to improve upon but he also really pays
          attention to the way you play as a whole and will provide with you
          tips/lessons on the entire aspect of guitar playing, even areas that
          you had not brought up with him. As a UCLA music student, I can't
          stress enough not only how incredibly talented he is just at playing
          the guitar but the vast knowledge of guitar playing, guitar tone,
          guitar "tricks", that really encompass all of the stuff a student
          would yearn for in a lesson. And the direction of the lesson is
          completely up to you, I've stopped Gabriel before and questioned him
          on why he played something a certain way and he gives you a detailed
          opinion on why he is doing it but also variations that might you suit
          your playing better. Furthermore, with his extensive background in
          music he can provide you with not only just the fundamentals and
          mechanics of guitar playing but crafting songs, music theory, and the
          structuring of soloing. Not to mention I think he's got every issue of
          guitar player magazine dating back to the 80s. I've taken lessons from
          nearly ever part of California(Sacramento, San Francisco, San Diego
          and LA) and I've yet to meet someone with his level of playing and
          dedication to his students.Â It's been a great pleasure to learn from
          him, watch him play, and any student looking to advance his skills
          need not look any further. Simply put, you're wasting your time going
          any place else, I know because I've been there.

          Gabe is the aspiring musician, teacher and great mentor who is willing

          had the opportunity to emerge with a very good foundation in playing
          guitar for the first time, and the many principles of guitar playing
          in general. Very interestingly, Gabe utilizes a common sense approach
          to motivate new students to proceed at their own pace. As a result,
          that helps my kid connecting and mastering each element in realistic

          I am so glad I found Gabe. I knew nothing about playing the guitar and
          he was absolutely the right person to start taking lessons from. He is
          incredibly patient, knowledgeable and talented, and he did not judge
          me for the fact that I only wanted to learn Taylor Swift songs (at
          least to start!). He tailored our lessons to my needs, and gave me
          printouts and exercises to take home when he knew they would help me.
          I had to take a break from our lessons for awhile to tend to my
          family, but I hope to start back up with Gabe when I have more time to
          dedicate to the guitar. In the mean time, Gabe gave me plenty of tools
          so I can practice on my own, try and write my own music, and keep it
          up enough so I'm not a beginner again when I get the chance to go back
