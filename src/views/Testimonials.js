        I have taken bass lessons with Gabe for about two years. During that
        time, he taught me how to play bass, the basics of guitar, and, most
        importantly, how to think like a musician. The area that helped me the
        most was music theory and how to play with anyone. Now, I have the tools
        to analyze any song I play or write and interpret why it may work. I can
        improve a bass line or be creative with the line in clever ways that I
        would not have thought about before. It has made me so much more
        comfortable jamming with anyone. With his lessons, I can get away with
        playing along to any song. Gabe can sometimes be a bit serious, but his
        seriousness made me focus much more on any given topic. The pace of the
        course is up to you, but Gabe will push you forward to help you play
        things you thought were above your level. Overall, Gabe is incredibly
        knowledgeable and can teach anything from the simplest concepts or
        techniques to something more complicated and technical. -Ben G.

        My daughter took guitar classes with Gabe for about 2 years. She made a
        quick progress immediately and ended up playing some amazing pieces. The
        one thing that really struck us was Gabe's ability to teach you pretty
        much anything: any level, any musical style, any random song you would
        come up with he can quickly figure out how to play it and what is the
        best way for you to learn it and adjust it to your level. We'd recommend
        Gabe as a music teacher to anybody! -Jaroslav S.

        As a new beginner to learning the acoustic guitar, Gabriel was a great
        teacher. He was quite passionate about playing the guitar and music in
        general. He was also well experienced and knowledgeable in playing the
        guitar. I was appreciative of his patience when grasping lessons &
        asking questions. I highly recommend. -Gerson L.

        I've been working with Gabe for the last four years and I went from
        total beginner at guitar to now being comfortably proficient in guitar,
        bass and the ukulele. Gabe is an awesome teacher and was able to present
        difficult concepts in an easily digestible manner. Whatever your music
        goals are, Gabe can help you meet them! Scheduling is flexible and
        prices are very reasonable for Los Angeles. Added bonus are his two
        amazing cats who will come say hello if you're lucky! -Maria L.

        Gabe is an awesome teacher! I took bass lessons from him and it was a
        great experience. He has a good way of teaching music concepts and will
        tailor lessons to what you're interested in learning. Also just a super
        interesting person in general. If you take lessons from him ask about
        all the places hes traveled for music/education. Very insightful and
        understanding instructor. -Matthew G.

        My daughter's been taking guitar lessons from G for more than 2-3 years
        now and she's still thrilled and excited every Tuesday when she sets up
        her electronic guitar and get ready for her lesson. She up to challenges
        in learning new pieces, new tricks or techniques. She started with
        acoustic guitar then gradually moved to electric after mastery. Guitar
        was not her first instrument though, she's taken piano, then flute
        before guitar but she's enjoying guitar better than the previous ones.
        She can just pick it up and roll. We're happy with G! He's a good
        teacher and very patient with the lessons and make sure my daughter
        really knows it before moving to new lesson. He definitely knows his
        forte :)) Highly recommended, definitely! -Bing L.

        Back in 2017, I bought my first ever guitar as it was something I wanted
        my entire life. With the wealth of knowledge on the internet, I thought
        I would be able to self teach myself. Two months later, my guitar was
        back to collecting dust. In 2018, I received a surprise gift for four
        lessons with a guitar instructor nearby, The Lord of the Strings! I was
        anxious, nervous and shy. I couldn't name the strings on my guitar, I
        knew no chord shapes or any music theory at all. Early on, I made it
        clear to Gabe what my intentions were with guitar. It's a tertiary hobby
        that I love, but I can't commit an immense amount of time to, but I
        would be attending classes as consistently as possible and inform him
        when I was unable to attend or put in the expected time. Some months, I
        was hyper motivated to learn music and guitar theory, others I just
        brought in riffs or songs that I liked and wanted to learn. Gabe
        continuously supported my approach throughout the time. Since 2018, I
        have gone to see Gabe pretty much weekly. Given the time I've put into
        the hobby, my skill reflects the effort and Gabe has taught me many of
        my favorite guitar riffs and helped push my understanding of music
        further and further. He has continuously been open minded about the
        music I listen to and am interested in playing for fun. If there was
        ever a part of a song Gabe was unfamiliar with, he would spend the time
        to learn the songs himself and often write out the tabs for me based on
        his ear or analyze how the guitarists perform in live videos. Four years
        later, I am still excited every week to meet with Gabe and spend time on
        this hobby. I am happy with my skill level in relation to the time I've
        put in and I've gone from someone who didn't know anything about the
        guitar to someone who can play most of their favorite riffs for fun and
        just pick up and play from time to time. I wouldn't have gotten to this
        point without Gabe and I would strongly recommend the Lord of the
        Strings to anyone interested in an attentive and motivating guitar
        instructor. -Sebastian D.

        My son has been taking weekly guitar lessons with Gabe since January
        2020, and always has postive things to say after every class. I can not
        stress enough how accommodating Gabe is with our schedule. Aside from
        going to school, my son works part-time and it seems like every other
        week, his work schedules him on the same day and time he has guitar
        class. So of course, I'm reaching out to Gabe, apologizing for the
        inconvenience, and requesting to reschedule. And he has had no issue
        rescheduling, everytime! What I appreciate the most about Gabe is his
        knowledge and passion for music. Extra points to him for having so much
        patience with my son, who can take a little longer than most, to grasp
        simple concepts. I'm hoping that my son continues to be happy playing
        guitar and I would love for him to continue taking lessons with Gabe for
        as long as he wants. If your in the Palms / West LA area, or any
        surrounding areas, and you're interested in guitar - newbie,
        intermediate or hard-core rocker - I'd recommend you reach out to Gabe.
        P.S: he has a cute cat who is extremely friendly! :) -Joanna F.

        I've been taking lessons with Gabe for 2 years, he's a fantastic teacher
        and I've learned so much. He takes great care of his students. Always
        has extra time for questions, and has flexible scheduling options. He
        creates a warm and inviting environment for his students and has really
        opened my eyes to what guitar can be. Highly recommend! -Max G.

        Gabe is the best. He is reasonably priced and exceptionally skilled in
        terms of both knowledge and in terms of teaching. He can teach at all
        levels, rote beginner or deeply experienced. He has USC credentials if
        that is important to you; he has an adorable cat which is objectively
        important. He has a great sense of humor, for what it's worth. I've had
        many guitar teachers; he's far and away the best of the bunch -Jackson

        I have been taking weekly guitar lessons with Gabe for more than a year
        now. He is a deeply skilled musician and teacher, and having him as my
        guide into the guitar has been a privilege and a pleasure. Gabe's
        knowledge of stringed instruments and music theory and instruction
        enables him to help me handle new challenges with a wide variety of
        exercises and practice techniques, so there is always a way forward. He
        is patient and able to adapt his guidance to any skill level. I
        recommend him very highly! -Paul D.

        I've been taking ukulele with Gabe for 5 months and it has been a great
        experience. I came to class the first day having bought my uke off
        amazon not knowing a thing and now I not only can play several songs and
        read tabs But I have a understanding of how to read music. I feel that
        the one on one classes really helped me lear the basics so much faster
        than any teach yourself method. It gave me things to work on during the
        week but also pushed me to learn something new each class. Even after
        just a few classes I was taking my uke to friends houses to play songs
        and everyone was so impressed! I highly recommend him for anyone looking
        to learn the ukulele or guitar. -Lena S.

      <p>
        I've been taking ukulele lessons from Gabe for the last couple of months
        and it's been a great experience. I tried learning on my own and made
        very slow process. After taking lessons from him I've improved so much
        and am enjoying it a lot more! -Sonia M.

        I've been taking acoustic guitar lessons with Gabe for just over 8
        months and I couldn't be happier with my progress to date. Â He's a
        knowledgeable, clear, and patient instructor that I would recommend to
        anyone at any level of skill. Â I feel like no matter what I want to
        learn or how far I advance, there will still be things I can learn from
        him. I had previously taught myself guitar ~15 years ago, but had hit a
        ceiling in my progress. Â I feel like Gabe and I spent the first few
        months reteaching/relearning some bad habits and cheats I had taught
        myself - I believe those habits and cheats actually created the ceiling
        I hit. Â He helped me lay a new, correct baseline of beginner theory
        that's enabled me to grow and learn so much faster than I could have on
        my own. His level of commitment to all areas of music, from theory to
        performance, informs the way he teaches you based on how you learn. Â If
        I'm not grasping a concept, he covers it multiple ways using different
        examples and tactics - making sure I find a way to latch on and "own"
        the material before moving on. Â I appreciate the way he allows his
        students to shape the progress and content of the lessons, if they
        desire. Â There's definitely structure and paced advancement as you
        progress, but if I show interest in a specific topic, song, or concept,
        Gabe will make room for it in our lessons and my practice. Â I never
        feel like we're moving too fast or too slow for my skill level - he
        understands where his students are and (I imagine) tailors everything
        you do/learn to the individual. He's also a super nice, interesting
        person who is easy to get along with - that's a huge plus when electing
        to spend time with someone to learn something new! Â 5 stars for Gabe.

        I'm a super beginner guitar player, and since taking lessons with Gabe
        (it's been over a year now) I can honestly say my playing has vastly
        improved! I always come out of every lesson with a bit of knowledge,
        whether theory-based or physical, that helps me grasp something that I
        couldn't before I walked in. Gabe is extremely patient, even when I ask
        the same questions over and over again -- helpful for a shy player like
        myself -- and the guy can honestly probably play any song on the planet.
        I'm looking forward to continuing my lessons with him and, who knows,
        maybe even performing in a coffee shop one day soon.Â Definitely highly
        recommended! Especially if you're trying to master music theory along
        with basic guitar skills. -Britney T.

      <p>
        Gabe did a great job at figuring out where I was as a guitarist and
        giving me helpful instruction from there. He's knowledgeable about
        everything you'd want to learn about jazz music. In less than a couple
        months, I have a much greater understanding of music theory. I look
        forward to learning a lot more! Recommend him big time to anyone wanting
        to take guitar lessons - not just aspiring jazz players. Also, he can
        teach the ukulele well too! -John C.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gabe lives up to all the aforementioned praises. Whether you are a
        beginner with no prior experience (like myself) searching for the basics
        or a vet looking to sharpen your skills, Gabe will be able to help you.
        He's a great teacher for all skill levels and most importantly, very
        patient. He has a great talent in breaking down complex ideas into terms
        a beginner would understand. I feel the lessons are customized to my
        interests, strengths and weaknesses. He has a flexible schedule, also.
        After a year under his tutelage, I can confidently say I can play the
        guitar. Although, it might be a little while longer before I am
        headlining. Definitely a class worth taking! PS. Did I mention he is
        patient! -Chip H.

        Gabe is the best! My 15-year-old son has been taking guitar lessons from
        Gabe for about seven months. Gabe is wonderfully knowledgeable in all
        aspects of guitar playing -- from techniques to theory, and
        improvisation to reading music. My son always looks forward to his
        lesson and I love being in the background while they work. -Amy S.

        Gabe is an amazing musician and it shows. Â I on the other hand just
        picked up a guitar to spend sometime by myself, in a room, away from
        work, two crazy little kids and all of the other stuff that keeps me
        from simply relaxing. Â That worked for a few weeks and then I got bored
        of the books or online videos. Â So I searched around and found Gabe (he
        had a kick ass deal for the first lesson!). Â The first lessons I assume
        were the typical lessons for someone who didn't even know how to hold a
        pick. Â Fingers here, look there, this is how you tune and oh hey, it's
        probably not working cause your amp isn't on. Â Seriously, I had no idea
        what I was doing. Â It's a year later and I love my guitar more than I
        ever thought I could. Â I play almost every night and it's not because
        I'm amazing at it but simply because Gabe challenges me. Â Of course
        I've improved, but more importantly I'm having a great time playing. Â
        Sure, the lessons are still a bit of work between a teacher and
        student.....but after every lesson I get better and have more fun than
        before. Â After we got past the basic stuff I began to ask certain
        questions about things. I was curious about: scales, this song or that
        song, Hendrix or The Beatles, etc. etc. Â Usually it was just curiosity
        of something or maybe a song that I could play if I just learned the
        simple way to play it. Â But Gabe, in his own very unique way, would
        basically push me to play the song the correct way....showing me piece
        by piece how to play the entire song. Â Sure, I still think Hendrix and
        John Frusciante are gods among mortals....but I can take a hack at some
        of their songs and have fun doing it! Â Let me be clear, Gabe isn't
        pushy by any means....he sorta just shows you that the song you thought
        was impossible....isn't. Â And then walks you through it until you can
        pick it all up with the skills (and new confidence) he just gave you.
        Gabe as a teacher is awesome.....but is seriously impressive as a
        musician. Â I 've mentioned countless songs to him and he just breaks
        them out without even needing to look at the music or hear the song. Â
        If he doesn't know the song you're talking about, once he hears it he
        usually can pick it up by ear. Â And don't even get me started on how
        good his beer brewing skills are!! An overall guitar savior for us mere
        mortals. -David J.

        I have had Gabe as a guitar teacher for a number years and I have
        nothing, but absolutely great things to say about him. Â When I first
        walked into my lesson I had some knowledge of music, but little to no
        knowledge of the guitar. Â He was and is extremely patient and explains
        everything from basic chords to music theory so anyone can understand.Â
        He is also willing to teach any song that you are interested in playing.
        Â If for some reason (and this is very rare) he doesn't know the song he
        will quickly find it and have you playing it by the end of the lesson. I
        was also amazed that after I had had lessons on the acoustic and
        electric guitar, one day I asked if he'd be willing to teach me on the
        ukulele. Â He immediately said yes and had me playing "Free Falling" by
        the end of the next lesson. Lastly, Gabe is also an outstanding guitar
        player. Â Occasionally he will play something he has written or part of
        something I haven't heard before and its just amazing! Â I highly
        recommend him as a teacher. Â You will NOT be disappointed. -Ryan P.

        Gabe is an exceptional guitar teacher. He is extremely patient which
        makes the lessons more fun and enjoyable for a beginner guitarist like
        me. At the same time Gabe knows how to push the student outside of their
        comfort zone. With his patience and encouragement I also feel up to the
        challenge without being afraid or embarrassed to make mistakes. He has
        an ability to break down the learning into very small steps and come up
        with drills and exercises to help with technique that I have not seen
        anywhere else. There are some music theory concepts that Gabe clearly
        explained in five minutes that I had never been able to understand
        before. With his instruction I feel that I am developing musical sense
        and ideas that I had not done with other instructors. I am very happy
        with my progress and I look forward to the lessons even when I haven't
        had much chance to practice during the week. I know I will learn and
        progress and have fun doing it. -Amit D.

        I've been fortunate to receive lessons from Gabriel for little over a
        year and half and the very first thing you will notice about his
        teaching methods and what separates him from the vast majority of other
        guitar teachers is that not only will he cater to what you specifically
        are trying to improve upon but he also really pays attention to the way
        you play as a whole and will provide with you tips/lessons on the entire
        aspect of guitar playing, even areas that you had not brought up with
        him. As a UCLA music student, I can't stress enough not only how
        incredibly talented he is just at playing the guitar but the vast
        knowledge of guitar playing, guitar tone, guitar "tricks", that really
        encompass all of the stuff a student would yearn for in a lesson. And
        the direction of the lesson is completely up to you, I've stopped
        Gabriel before and questioned him on why he played something a certain
        way and he gives you a detailed opinion on why he is doing it but also
        variations that might you suit your playing better. Furthermore, with
        his extensive background in music he can provide you with not only just
        the fundamentals and mechanics of guitar playing but crafting songs,
        music theory, and the structuring of soloing. Not to mention I think
        he's got every issue of guitar player magazine dating back to the 80s.
        I've taken lessons from nearly ever part of California(Sacramento, San
        Francisco, San Diego and LA) and I've yet to meet someone with his level
        of playing and dedication to his students.Â It's been a great pleasure
        to learn from him, watch him play, and any student looking to advance
        his skills need not look any further. Simply put, you're wasting your
        time going any place else, I know because I've been there. -Jarrett L.

        Gabe is the aspiring musician, teacher and great mentor who is willing
        to really work with the student enthusiastically. My kid (9 years old)
        had the opportunity to emerge with a very good foundation in playing
        guitar for the first time, and the many principles of guitar playing in
        general. Very interestingly, Gabe utilizes a common sense approach to
        motivate new students to proceed at their own pace. As a result, that
        helps my kid connecting and mastering each element in realistic way. I
        like Gabes guitar lesson approach that is without promising instant
        success delusion to the student as well as parents. The time and money
        invested into this guitar lessons was worth a lot to us as a parent and
        to my son.We strongly recommend to anyone's kids to take his classes. I
        shall say, "Designed for beginners who want to play Music/Guitar lessons
        quickly by ear." -Joel & son Natan
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a fine guitar/music teacher...Gabe not only knows his craft on a
        high level (playing) but canÂ communicate the how-to in a simple yet
        meaningful way. -Joy S.
      </p>

        I am so glad I found Gabe. I knew nothing about playing the guitar and
        he was absolutely the right person to start taking lessons from. He is
        incredibly patient, knowledgeable and talented, and he did not judge me
        for the fact that I only wanted to learn Taylor Swift songs (at least to
        start!). He tailored our lessons to my needs, and gave me printouts and
        exercises to take home when he knew they would help me. I had to take a
        break from our lessons for awhile to tend to my family, but I hope to
        start back up with Gabe when I have more time to dedicate to the guitar.
        In the mean time, Gabe gave me plenty of tools so I can practice on my
        own, try and write my own music, and keep it up enough so I'm not a
        beginner again when I get the chance to go back to him. -Sara R

        Self-taught musician playing guitar for 8+ years, interested in
        technical metal guitar. After meetingÂ GabeÂ for our first session I was
        pleased to find out that he's very friendly/chill. Â His teaching style
        was a no-brainer for me to follow. Once key playing issues (I had picked
        up some bad habits) were identified, he made a very straightforward
        daily warm-up & practice regimen for me to work on.Â After just a week
        of ~20 min. a day my playing wasÂ noticeably cleaner and professional. Â
        I was definitelyÂ surprisedÂ how quickly I started to progress. Â Was a
        much needed push in the right direction.Highly recommended! -Jeff K.

        I had never taken a lesson on anything but a single note instrument,
        until I started guitar lessons with Gabe. I didn't know what to expect
        in what time frame, and was pleasantly surprised to be playing some of
        my favorite songs in a relatively short amount of time. Gabe is a very
        articulate, patient, nonjudgmental teacher, who intuitively knows what
        the student needs, in order to make the next breakthrough, at any given
        time. I highly recommend lessons with Gabe, if you are interested in
        learning how and why, as he doles out both technique and theory in the
        right increments, at the appropriate time. -Kathy H.

        Gabe is very patient and encouraging to the beginning guitar student. He
        is also very interested in each student's musical taste and tailors the
        music he teaches accordingly. -Eve H.

        Gabe is a great guitar teacher. He's very easy-going and patient and is
        willing to work with whatever pace is most comfortable to you. I had
        some very basic music knowledge before seeing Gabe, but he taught me all
        the basics of guitar from the ground up. Within a few months I was
        playing some of my favorite songs. Meanwhile I was practicing all the
        chords and learning other basic theory that Gabe is great at explaining
        to a novice such as myself. The other great thing about Gabe is that he
        always encourages you to try some new techniques and styles in addition
        to what you prefer to listen or play on your own time. I highly
        recommend him to anyone looking to get started playing guitar or to
        refine the skills you already have. -Andrew H.

        I'm very pleased with my lessons. I'm a rank beginner -- couldn't read
        music and have never studied an instrument before. Gabe is
        knowledgeable, patient, and seriously interested in helping me progress.
        I believe I am progressing, which is the proof in the pudding. Gabe has
        been a wonderful teacher for me over the past 16 months. When I started
        my lessons with him I barely knew one end of the guitar from the other.
        I've made far more progress than I ever imagined possible in just a
        little over a year. I can actually play my guitar and am beginning to be
        able to read music. Gabe has been unfailingly encouraging and patient
        with my clumsiness -- which means a great deal to me. - Joanne O.

        Gabe is an unbelievably talented, knowledgeable, and patient teacher. I
        took some lessons as a kid but at that time, I wasn't interested in much
        more than just being able to play some of my favorite tunes. After
        rediscovering my interest in playing and wanting to learn more, I was
        lucky enough to find Gabe and finally get the instruction in theory and
        fundamentals that I needed to improve. I appreciate Gabe's ability to
        cater to the songs and types of music I am interested in learning, while
        also exposing me to music I wouldn't have thought to dig into on my own.
        Whether you are a beginner or would like to polish up on your skills,
        take a lesson, go watch Gabe play live, and have a ton of fun. - Adam P.

        Gabe is incredibly knowledgable at his craft, and can explain what he's
        doing in a way suitable for everybody. Gabe introduced me to some
        exercises for speed and creativity that I use almost everyday to keep my
        fingers loose. Watching Gabe play is inspiring, to say the least. You
        can see on his videos online just how fast and accurate Gabe plays -
        it's a thrill to sit in a room which that kind of talent. He's also got
        a cool cat that really likes my guitar case. Go see him and definitely
        practice ALL THE TIME - if you do, Gabe can turn you into a serious
        player. Oh, and he's a cool guy, too. Easy to talk to and ask questions.

        When I started taking lessons with Gabe, I had never even held a guitar
        before! Now, four years later, I can strum just about anything at a
        campfire, play through many of the classic rock standards (Stairway to
        Heaven, Hotel California, etc.) and am working on my confidence for
        improvising as blues lead guitar. Gabe is a patient and encouraging
        teacher. He knows a lot of music history and theory, which gives me a
        deep understanding of why we play what we do. This knowledge allows me
        to go beyond mere imitation toward (eventually) new musical ideas. -Leah

        Gabe is an incredible teacher! Â I had been playing as a self taught
        guitarist for 20 years and never got to where I wanted to be. After a
        year of weekly lessons, I finally was playing the soul, funk, blues and
        rock that I always wanted to play. Â He shaped my ears and my fingers! Â
        I have skills and knowledge I never thought I would have, but always
        wished that I did. Â He is a patient, articulate, and encouraging
        instructor.Â I took weekly lessons with Gabe for three years.Â Â
        Honestly, probably the best money I've ever spent on myself! -Eric R.

        on the exact tools you need to become a stronger guitar player.Â Â No
        time is ever waisted.Â Â Gabe instinctively knows what it takes to make
        you grow. -Sara W.

        Taking lessons from Gabe was great. He's clearly a talented player, but
        also a gifted teacher. Lessons were fun and tailored to my abilities and
        interests. I would highly recommend Gabe. -Steve H
