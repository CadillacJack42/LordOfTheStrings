        Gabriel is originally from Maryland, in the Washington, D.C. suburbs and
        began his musical explorations on the piano as a child, before teaching
        himself guitar as a teenager. While attending Muhlenberg College in
        Allentown, PA, Gabriel began formal lessons in jazz guitar with Tom
        Kozic (a student of Joe Pass, Howard Roberts, Tal Farlow, and Kenny
        Burrell) and Dr. Ted Conner, as well as classical music theory and
        composition with Dr. Douglas Ovens. During his education, Gabriel was a
        member of several jazz improvisational groups, a big band orchestra, and
        he also played in the pit orchestra for musical productions. After
        graduating cum laude with a degree in Music, Gabriel made his way to
        Chicago to work on a Masters in Jazz Studies at DePaul University,
        studying with Bob Palmieri (a student of John Scofield), trumpeter Dr.
        Robert Lark, and saxophonist Peter Ballin. While at DePaul he continued
        to play and record in several jazz combos and big bands, while also
        finding the time to jam at some of the great blues bars in the city.

        Leaving Chicago behind in 2003, Gabriel traveled to Los Angeles to
        pursue his Doctorate in Musicology at the University of Southern
        California, where he studied Indian classical music, Jazz History, and
        20th century Western art music, receiving a Masters in Musicology along
        the way and becoming a Doctoral Candidate. As part of his coursework, he
        continued his guitar studies with David Becker and Tim Kobza, while also
        sitting in on master classes with Joe Diorio, Sid Jacobs, Pat Martino,
        Steve Trovato, and Pat Metheny. For his Ethnomusicology studies, Gabriel
        learned to play the tabla, a set of hand drums from India. He learned
        even more about Indian culture and music while abroad in India for 6
        months in the fall/winter of 2006/2007, researching for his
        dissertation. Gabriel's fascination with Indian music has influenced not
        only his compositional writing and improvisational style, but also his
        teaching approach. In 2010, Gabriel decided to leave his academic
        studies to pursue his performance and teaching career full time, which
        has led to opportunities to perform, record, and write with several
        bands and artists, as well as teach some well known professional
        players.
