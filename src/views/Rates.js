      <h3>General Lesson Info</h3>
      <p>
        I offer 30 minute, 45 minute and 1 hour long lessons. Lesson rates are
        commensurate with my experience and ability, and quite reasonable for
        the expertise that I can provide. You may contact me with specific
        pricing inquiries regarding lesson rates or for anything not listed,
        including gift certificates or customized Master Classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I offer an introductory lesson at a discount rate, as well as monthly
        discounts for those students paying for monthly blocks of lessons
        up-front following the introductory lesson. Prices listed below include
        the monthly discount. All lessons are billed by the month, but if you
        would like to set up a single lesson, please contact me for rates.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I also offer FLEX lessons for those who can't make a weekly appointment.
        With FLEX you pay for 4 lesson credits and you have 8 weeks to use them
        at your convenience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I accept cash or check, Venmo, Zelle or you can use a credit card via
        PayPal to prepay for your lessons.

      <strong>LESSON POLICIES</strong>
      <p>TUITION:</p>
      <p>
        Tuition includes the time spent with your instructor, as well as time
        slot reservation, advice/answered questions/etc. outside the lesson via
        phone/email, lesson materials, and your instructor’s pre-lesson
        preparation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Package tuition for continuing weekly students is due by the 1st of the
        month. Students should have payments ready at the lesson closest to the
        1st of the month, either before or after, and will be considered late
        after the 7th. Payments can be mailed, or sent via PayPal, Zelle or
        Venmo, if you think you’ll be late. Tuition will be adjusted depending
        on the number of lesson days in the month...either 4 or 5, depending on
        the day of the week and the month. New students who start mid-month will
        be pro-rated for the remainder of the current month.
      </p>
      <p>
        FLEX students will be billed 4 lessons at a time and sent payment
        reminders prior to their last pre-paid lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payments may be made in cash or by personal check. Credit card, PayPal,
        Zelle or Venmo payments may also be made securely online or in person.
        Tuition is non-refundable.
      </p>
      <p>ATTENDANCE:</p>
      <p>
        Your weekly lesson time is yours and yours alone, therefore missing or
        rescheduling lessons should be kept to a minimum, as it precludes me
        from scheduling committed new students. I require 24-hours’ notice to
        cancel lessons with the option to make-up. If less than 24-hours’ notice
        is provided, no make-up will be given for the missed lesson, NO
        EXCEPTIONS. Students who cancel lessons often will be removed from the
        schedule per my discretion.
      </p>
      <p>MAKE-UPS:</p>
      <p>
        I offer specific make-up time slots, lesson extensions, or online lesson
        make-ups throughout the week and weekend, and will do my best to find
        suitable make-ups when warranted. Unless otherwise discussed, lessons
        can only be made-up within the month that they are missed. Any missed
        lessons that are unable to be made-up will be forfeited. Missed or
        cancelled make-ups will be forfeited as well. I continue to be as
        flexible as possible with regard to scheduling, so exceptions will be
        made on a case by case basis.
      </p>
      <p>ILLNESS:</p>
      <p>
        In consideration for the instructor and others, students should not
        attend lessons when ill. Please notify me as early as possible if you
        must miss a lesson due to illness. 24-hours’ notice is still required,
        but when this is not possible due to sudden onset of illness, please
        call/text/email first thing in the morning on the day of your lesson if
        you must cancel. Missed lessons due to illness will be handled the same
        as regular lessons...I will offer a make-up, when possible.
      </p>
      <p>HOLIDAYS:</p>
      <p>
        The following holidays are observed. Students will not be scheduled or
        charged for lessons on these days.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>New Year's Eve</li>
        <li>New Year's Day</li>
        <li>Easter Sunday</li>
        <li>Memorial Day</li>
        <li>Independence Day</li>
        <li>Labor Day</li>
        <li>Thanksgiving Day</li>
        <li>Christmas Eve</li>
        <li>Christmas Day</li>
      </ul>
      <p>TEACHER CANCELLATIONS:</p>
      <p>
        Students and parents are asked to understand that because I continue to
        be an active performer, occasionally scheduling conflicts arise, making
        it necessary to re-schedule or suspend lessons for a short time. In
        these cases, ample notice will be provided, and every effort will be
        made to offer make-up lessons or lesson credits when appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>DISCONTINUING LESSONS:</p>
      <p>
        A minimum of 2-weeks’ notice is required to discontinue lessons. If a
        student misses or cancels, with less than 24 hour notice, or no notice,
        2 lessons in a row, they will be removed from the schedule. Tuition is
        non-refundable.
