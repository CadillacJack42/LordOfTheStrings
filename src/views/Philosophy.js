        I have been teaching music for over 20 years and can get you playing in
        no time. Typically, beginning students start out by learning basic
        chords and rhythms using well known songs, while also building up core
        fundamentals and good practice habits. As students progress, they then
        move on to custom tailored sessions at the intermediate or advanced
        level. I am a patient instructor and love working with beginners to get
        them headed in the right direction, just as much as I enjoy taking
        advanced students to the next level. I care deeply about all of my
        students, and enjoy seeing the progress each one makes.

        I am well versed in most styles: jazz, blues, rock, pop, country, funk,
        punk, metal, acoustic, latin, prog rock, shred, world, classical, etc.,
        so I am capable of playing/teaching anything. Often my students bring in
        songs that I've never heard or played before, and I'm able to teach them
        how to play them within minutes upon hearing them. I pride myself on
        being versatile and enabling each student to achieve their own goals.

        One thing that sets me apart from other music lesson providers is my
        extensive knowledge about the history of music, the instruments, and
        music theory. I am able to relate whatever we are working on to the core
        fundamentals of playing the instrument and music in general. I feel it
        is essential to understand what you are playing not just how to play it.
