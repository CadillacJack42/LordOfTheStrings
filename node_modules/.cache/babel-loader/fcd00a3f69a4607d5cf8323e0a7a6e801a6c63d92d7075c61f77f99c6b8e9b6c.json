His level of commitment to all areas of music, from theory to performance, informs the way he teaches you based on how you learn. \\xC2 If I'm not grasping a concept, he covers it multiple ways using different examples and tactics - making sure I find a way to latch on and \\\"own\\\" the material before moving on. \\xC2 I appreciate the way he allows his students to shape the progress and content of the lessons, if they desire. \\xC2 There's definitely structure and paced advancement as you progress, but if I show interest in a specific topic, song, or concept, Gabe will make room for it in our lessons and my practice. \\xC2 I never feel like we're moving too fast or too slow for my skill level - he understands where his students are and (I imagine) tailors everything you do/learn to the individual.

I came to class the first day having bought my uke off\n        amazon not knowing a thing and now I not only can play several songs and\n        read tabs But I have a understanding of how to read music. I feel that\n        the one on one classes really helped me lear the basics so much faster\n        than any teach yourself method. It gave me things to work on during the\n        week but also pushed me to learn something new each class. Even after\n        just a few classes I was taking my uke to friends houses to play songs\n        and everyone was so impressed! I highly recommend him for anyone looking\n        to learn the ukulele or guitar. -Lena S.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I've been taking ukulele lessons from Gabe for the last couple of months\n        and it's been a great experience. I tried learning on my own and made\n        very slow process. After taking lessons from him I've improved so much\n        and am enjoying it a lot more! -Sonia M.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I've been taking acoustic guitar lessons with Gabe for just over 8\n        months and I couldn't be happier with my progress to date. Â He's a\n        knowledgeable, clear, and patient instructor that I would recommend to\n        anyone at any level of skill. Â I feel like no matter what I want to\n        learn or how far I advance, there will still be things I can learn from\n        him. I had previously taught myself guitar ~15 years ago, but had hit a\n        ceiling in my progress. Â I feel like Gabe and I spent the first few\n        months reteaching/relearning some bad habits and cheats I had taught\n        myself - I believe those habits and cheats actually created the ceiling\n        I hit. Â He helped me lay a new, correct baseline of beginner theory\n        that's enabled me to grow and learn so much faster than I could have on\n        my own. His level of commitment to all areas of music, from theory to\n        performance, informs the way he teaches you based on how you learn. Â If\n        I'm not grasping a concept, he covers it multiple ways using different\n        examples and tactics - making sure I find a way to latch on and \"own\"\n        the material before moving on. Â I appreciate the way he allows his\n        students to shape the progress and content of the lessons, if they\n        desire. Â There's definitely structure and paced advancement as you\n        progress, but if I show interest in a specific topic, song, or concept,\n        Gabe will make room for it in our lessons and my practice. Â I never\n        feel like we're moving too fast or too slow for my skill level - he\n        understands where his students are and (I imagine) tailors everything\n        you do/learn to the individual. He's also a super nice, interesting\n        person who is easy to get along with - that's a huge plus when electing\n        to spend time with someone to learn something new! Â 5 stars for Gabe.\n        -Jennie A.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I'm a super beginner guitar player, and since taking lessons with Gabe\n        (it's been over a year now) I can honestly say my playing has vastly\n        improved! I always come out of every lesson with a bit of knowledge,\n        whether theory-based or physical, that helps me grasp something that I\n        couldn't before I walked in. Gabe is extremely patient, even when I ask\n        the same questions over and over again -- helpful for a shy player like\n        myself -- and the guy can honestly probably play any song on the planet.\n        I'm looking forward to continuing my lessons with him and, who knows,\n        maybe even performing in a coffee shop one day soon.Â Definitely highly\n        recommended! Especially if you're trying to master music theory along\n        with basic guitar skills. -Britney T.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Gabe did a great job at figuring out where I was as a guitarist and\n        giving me helpful instruction from there. He's knowledgeable about\n        everything you'd want to learn about jazz music. In less than a couple\n        months, I have a much greater understanding of music theory. I look\n        forward to learning a lot more! Recommend him big time to anyone wanting\n        to take guitar lessons - not just aspiring jazz players. Also, he can\n        teach the ukulele well too! -John C.\n      </p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p></p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n"],"mappings":";;AAAA,OAAO,MAAMA,YAAY,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EAChC,oBACEC,OAAA;IAAAC,QAAA,gBACED,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAI;IAAY;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACrBL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAeH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAQH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAMH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAQH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAOH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAYH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IA+BH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAiBH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAMH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAQH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IASH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAWH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAKH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IA2BH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAYH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAG;IAQH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACPL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACPL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACPL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACPL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACPL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACPL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACPL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACPL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACPL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACPL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACPL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACPL,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACJ,CAAC;AAEV,CAAC;AAACC,EAAA,GAjOWP,YAAY;AAAA,IAAAO,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
