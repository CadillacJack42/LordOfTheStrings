Credit card, PayPal,\n        Zelle or Venmo payments may also be made securely online or in person.\n        Tuition is non-refundable.\n      </p>\n      <p>ATTENDANCE:</p>\n      <p>\n        Your weekly lesson time is yours and yours alone, therefore missing or\n        rescheduling lessons should be kept to a minimum, as it precludes me\n        from scheduling committed new students. I require 24-hours’ notice to\n        cancel lessons with the option to make-up. If less than 24-hours’ notice\n        is provided, no make-up will be given for the missed lesson, NO\n        EXCEPTIONS. Students who cancel lessons often will be removed from the\n        schedule per my discretion.\n      </p>\n      <p>MAKE-UPS:</p>\n      <p>\n        I offer specific make-up time slots, lesson extensions, or online lesson\n        make-ups throughout the week and weekend, and will do my best to find\n        suitable make-ups when warranted. Unless otherwise discussed, lessons\n        can only be made-up within the month that they are missed. Any missed\n        lessons that are unable to be made-up will be forfeited. Missed or\n        cancelled make-ups will be forfeited as well. I continue to be as\n        flexible as possible with regard to scheduling, so exceptions will be\n        made on a case by case basis.\n      </p>\n      <p>ILLNESS:</p>\n      <p>\n        In consideration for the instructor and others, students should not\n        attend lessons when ill. Please notify me as early as possible if you\n        must miss a lesson due to illness. 24-hours’ notice is still required,\n        but when this is not possible due to sudden onset of illness, please\n        call/text/email first thing in the morning on the day of your lesson if\n        you must cancel. Missed lessons due to illness will be handled the same\n        as regular lessons...I will offer a make-up, when possible.\n      </p>\n      <p>HOLIDAYS:</p>\n      <p>\n        The following holidays are observed. Students will not be scheduled or\n        charged for lessons on these days.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>New Year's Eve</li>\n        <li>New Year's Day</li>\n        <li>Easter Sunday</li>\n        <li>Memorial Day</li>\n        <li>Independence Day</li>\n        <li>Labor Day</li>\n        <li>Thanksgiving Day</li>\n        <li>Christmas Eve</li>\n        <li>Christmas Day</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>TEACHER CANCELLATIONS:</p>\n      <p>\n        Students and parents are asked to understand that because I continue to\n        be an active performer, occasionally scheduling conflicts arise, making\n        it necessary to re-schedule or suspend lessons for a short time. In\n        these cases, ample notice will be provided, and every effort will be\n        made to offer make-up lessons or lesson credits when appropriate.\n      </p>\n      <p>DISCONTINUING LESSONS:</p>\n      <p>\n        A minimum of 2-weeks’ notice is required to discontinue lessons. If a\n        student misses or cancels, with less than 24 hour notice, or no notice,\n        2 lessons in a row, they will be removed from the schedule. Tuition is\n        non-refundable.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n
