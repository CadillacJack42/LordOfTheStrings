With the wealth of knowledge on the internet, I thought I would be able to self teach myself. Two months later, my guitar was back to collecting dust. In 2018, I received a surprise gift for four lessons with a guitar instructor nearby, The Lord of the Strings! I was anxious, nervous and shy. I couldn't name the strings on my guitar, I knew no chord shapes or any music theory at all. Early on, I made it clear to Gabe what my intentions were with guitar. It's a tertiary hobby that I love, but I can't commit an immense amount of time to, but I would be attending classes as consistently as possible and inform him when I was unable to attend or put in the expected time. Some months, I was hyper motivated to learn music and guitar theory, others I just brought in riffs or songs that I liked and wanted to learn. Gabe continuously supported my approach throughout the time. Since 2018, I have gone to see Gabe pretty much weekly. Given the time I've put into the hobby, my skill reflects the effort and Gabe has taught me many of my favorite guitar riffs and helped push my understanding of music further and further. He has continuously been open minded about the music I listen to and am interested in playing for fun. If there was ever a part of a song Gabe was unfamiliar with, he would spend the time to learn the songs himself and often write out the tabs for me based on his ear or analyze how the guitarists perform in live videos. Four years later, I am still excited every week to meet with Gabe and spend time on this hobby. I am happy with my skill level in relation to the time I've put in and I've gone from someone who didn't know anything about the guitar to someone who can play most of their favorite riffs for fun and just pick up and play from time to time. I wouldn't have gotten to this point without Gabe and I would strongly recommend the Lord of the Strings to anyone interested in an attentive and motivating guitar instructor. -Sebastian D.\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 97,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"blockquote\", {\n      className: \"student-testimonials-proper\",\n      children: \"My son has been taking weekly guitar lessons with Gabe since January 2020, and always has postive things to say after every class.

With the wealth of knowledge on the internet, I thought\n        I would be able to self teach myself. Two months later, my guitar was\n        back to collecting dust. In 2018, I received a surprise gift for four\n        lessons with a guitar instructor nearby, The Lord of the Strings! I was\n        anxious, nervous and shy. I couldn't name the strings on my guitar, I\n        knew no chord shapes or any music theory at all. Early on, I made it\n        clear to Gabe what my intentions were with guitar. It's a tertiary hobby\n        that I love, but I can't commit an immense amount of time to, but I\n        would be attending classes as consistently as possible and inform him\n        when I was unable to attend or put in the expected time. Some months, I\n        was hyper motivated to learn music and guitar theory, others I just\n        brought in riffs or songs that I liked and wanted to learn. Gabe\n        continuously supported my approach throughout the time. Since 2018, I\n        have gone to see Gabe pretty much weekly. Given the time I've put into\n        the hobby, my skill reflects the effort and Gabe has taught me many of\n        my favorite guitar riffs and helped push my understanding of music\n        further and further. He has continuously been open minded about the\n        music I listen to and am interested in playing for fun. If there was\n        ever a part of a song Gabe was unfamiliar with, he would spend the time\n        to learn the songs himself and often write out the tabs for me based on\n        his ear or analyze how the guitarists perform in live videos. Four years\n        later, I am still excited every week to meet with Gabe and spend time on\n        this hobby. I am happy with my skill level in relation to the time I've\n        put in and I've gone from someone who didn't know anything about the\n        guitar to someone who can play most of their favorite riffs for fun and\n        just pick up and play from time to time. I wouldn't have gotten to this\n        point without Gabe and I would strongly recommend the Lord of the\n        Strings to anyone interested in an attentive and motivating guitar\n        instructor. -Sebastian D.\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote className=\"student-testimonials-proper\">\n        My son has been taking weekly guitar lessons with Gabe since January\n        2020, and always has postive things to say after every class.

Â I feel like Gabe and I spent the first few\n        months reteaching/relearning some bad habits and cheats I had taught\n        myself - I believe those habits and cheats actually created the ceiling\n        I hit. Â He helped me lay a new, correct baseline of beginner theory\n        that's enabled me to grow and learn so much faster than I could have on\n        my own. His level of commitment to all areas of music, from theory to\n        performance, informs the way he teaches you based on how you learn. Â If\n        I'm not grasping a concept, he covers it multiple ways using different\n        examples and tactics - making sure I find a way to latch on and \"own\"\n        the material before moving on. Â I appreciate the way he allows his\n        students to shape the progress and content of the lessons, if they\n        desire. Â There's definitely structure and paced advancement as you\n        progress, but if I show interest in a specific topic, song, or concept,\n        Gabe will make room for it in our lessons and my practice. Â I never\n        feel like we're moving too fast or too slow for my skill level - he\n        understands where his students are and (I imagine) tailors everything\n        you do/learn to the individual.

I look\n        forward to learning a lot more! Recommend him big time to anyone wanting\n        to take guitar lessons - not just aspiring jazz players.

He has a great talent in breaking down complex ideas into terms\n        a beginner would understand. I feel the lessons are customized to my\n        interests, strengths and weaknesses. He has a flexible schedule, also.\n        After a year under his tutelage, I can confidently say I can play the\n        guitar.

Â I on the other hand just\n        picked up a guitar to spend sometime by myself, in a room, away from\n        work, two crazy little kids and all of the other stuff that keeps me\n        from simply relaxing. Â That worked for a few weeks and then I got bored\n        of the books or online videos. Â So I searched around and found Gabe (he\n        had a kick ass deal for the first lesson!). Â The first lessons I assume\n        were the typical lessons for someone who didn't even know how to hold a\n        pick. Â Fingers here, look there, this is how you tune and oh hey, it's\n        probably not working cause your amp isn't on. Â Seriously, I had no idea\n        what I was doing. Â It's a year later and I love my guitar more than I\n        ever thought I could. Â I play almost every night and it's not because\n        I'm amazing at it but simply because Gabe challenges me. Â Of course\n        I've improved, but more importantly I'm having a great time playing. Â\n        Sure, the lessons are still a bit of work between a teacher and\n        student.....but after every lesson I get better and have more fun than\n        before. Â After we got past the basic stuff I began to ask certain\n        questions about things. I was curious about: scales, this song or that\n        song, Hendrix or The Beatles, etc. etc. Â Usually it was just curiosity\n        of something or maybe a song that I could play if I just learned the\n        simple way to play it. Â But Gabe, in his own very unique way, would\n        basically push me to play the song the correct way....showing me piece\n        by piece how to play the entire song. Â Sure, I still think Hendrix and\n        John Frusciante are gods among mortals....but I can take a hack at some\n        of their songs and have fun doing it! Â Let me be clear, Gabe isn't\n        pushy by any means....he sorta just shows you that the song you thought\n        was impossible....isn't. Â And then walks you through it until you can\n        pick it all up with the skills (and new confidence) he just gave you.\n        Gabe as a teacher is awesome.....but is seriously impressive as a\n        musician. Â I 've mentioned countless songs to him and he just breaks\n        them out without even needing to look at the music or hear the song. Â\n        If he doesn't know the song you're talking about, once he hears it he\n        usually can pick it up by ear. Â And don't even get me started on how\n        good his beer brewing skills are!! An overall guitar savior for us mere\n        mortals. -David J.\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote className=\"student-testimonials-proper\">\n        I have had Gabe as a guitar teacher for a number years and I have\n        nothing, but absolutely great things to say about him.

Â He was and is extremely patient and explains\n        everything from basic chords to music theory so anyone can understand.Â\n        He is also willing to teach any song that you are interested in playing.\n        Â If for some reason (and this is very rare) he doesn't know the song he\n        will quickly find it and have you playing it by the end of the lesson. I\n        was also amazed that after I had had lessons on the acoustic and\n        electric guitar, one day I asked if he'd be willing to teach me on the\n        ukulele. Â He immediately said yes and had me playing \"Free Falling\" by\n        the end of the next lesson. Lastly, Gabe is also an outstanding guitar\n        player.

As a UCLA music student, I can't stress enough not only how\n        incredibly talented he is just at playing the guitar but the vast\n        knowledge of guitar playing, guitar tone, guitar \"tricks\", that really\n        encompass all of the stuff a student would yearn for in a lesson. And\n        the direction of the lesson is completely up to you, I've stopped\n        Gabriel before and questioned him on why he played something a certain\n        way and he gives you a detailed opinion on why he is doing it but also\n        variations that might you suit your playing better. Furthermore, with\n        his extensive background in music he can provide you with not only just\n        the fundamentals and mechanics of guitar playing but crafting songs,\n        music theory, and the structuring of soloing. Not to mention I think\n        he's got every issue of guitar player magazine dating back to the 80s.\n        I've taken lessons from nearly ever part of California(Sacramento, San\n        Francisco, San Diego and LA) and I've yet to meet someone with his level\n        of playing and dedication to his students.Â It's been a great pleasure\n        to learn from him, watch him play, and any student looking to advance\n        his skills need not look any further.
