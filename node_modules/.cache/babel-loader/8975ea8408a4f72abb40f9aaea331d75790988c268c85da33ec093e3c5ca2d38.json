He's very easy-going and patient and is willing to work with whatever pace is most comfortable to you. I had some very basic music knowledge before seeing Gabe, but he taught me all the basics of guitar from the ground up. Within a few months I was playing some of my favorite songs. Meanwhile I was practicing all the chords and learning other basic theory that Gabe is great at explaining to a novice such as myself. The other great thing about Gabe is that he always encourages you to try some new techniques and styles in addition to what you prefer to listen or play on your own time. I highly recommend him to anyone looking to get started playing guitar or to refine the skills you already have.\", /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"br\", {}, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 623,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"br\", {}, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 624,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"strong\", {\n          children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"em\", {\n            children: \"-Andrew H.\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 626,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 625,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this)]\n      }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 611,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"blockquote\", {\n        className: \"student-testimonials-proper\",\n        children: [\"I'm very pleased with my lessons.

With the wealth of knowledge on the internet, I\n          thought I would be able to self teach myself. Two months later, my\n          guitar was back to collecting dust.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          In 2018, I received a surprise gift for four lessons with a guitar\n          instructor nearby, The Lord of the Strings! I was anxious, nervous and\n          shy. I couldn't name the strings on my guitar, I knew no chord shapes\n          or any music theory at all.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          Early on, I made it clear to Gabe what my intentions were with guitar.\n          It's a tertiary hobby that I love, but I can't commit an immense\n          amount of time to, but I would be attending classes as consistently as\n          possible and inform him when I was unable to attend or put in the\n          expected time. Some months, I was hyper motivated to learn music and\n          guitar theory, others I just brought in riffs or songs that I liked\n          and wanted to learn. Gabe continuously supported my approach\n          throughout the time.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          Since 2018, I have gone to see Gabe pretty much weekly. Given the time\n          I've put into the hobby, my skill reflects the effort and Gabe has\n          taught me many of my favorite guitar riffs and helped push my\n          understanding of music further and further. He has continuously been\n          open minded about the music I listen to and am interested in playing\n          for fun. If there was ever a part of a song Gabe was unfamiliar with,\n          he would spend the time to learn the songs himself and often write out\n          the tabs for me based on his ear or analyze how the guitarists perform\n          in live videos.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          Four years later, I am still excited every week to meet with Gabe and\n          spend time on this hobby. I am happy with my skill level in relation\n          to the time I've put in and I've gone from someone who didn't know\n          anything about the guitar to someone who can play most of their\n          favorite riffs for fun and just pick up and play from time to time. I\n          wouldn't have gotten to this point without Gabe and I would strongly\n          recommend the Lord of the Strings to anyone interested in an attentive\n          and motivating guitar instructor.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          <strong>\n            <em>-Sebastian D.</em>\n          </strong>\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote className=\"student-testimonials-proper\">\n          My son has been taking weekly guitar lessons with Gabe since January\n          2020, and always has postive things to say after every class.

The first lessons I assume were the typical lessons\n          for someone who didn't even know how to hold a pick. Fingers here,\n          look there, this is how you tune and oh hey, it's probably not working\n          cause your amp isn't on.

Of course I've improved, but\n          more importantly I'm having a great time playing. Sure, the lessons\n          are still a bit of work between a teacher and student.....but after\n          every lesson I get better and have more fun than before.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          After we got past the basic stuff I began to ask certain questions\n          about things. I was curious about: scales, this song or that song,\n          Hendrix or The Beatles, etc. etc. Usually it was just curiosity of\n          something or maybe a song that I could play if I just learned the\n          simple way to play it. But Gabe, in his own very unique way, would\n          basically push me to play the song the correct way....showing me piece\n          by piece how to play the entire song. Sure, I still think Hendrix and\n          John Frusciante are gods among mortals....but I can take a hack at\n          some of their songs and have fun doing it!\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          Let me be clear, Gabe isn't pushy by any means....he sorta just shows\n          you that the song you thought was impossible....isn't. And then walks\n          you through it until you can pick it all up with the skills (and new\n          confidence) he just gave you.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          Gabe as a teacher is awesome.....but is seriously impressive as a\n          musician. I 've mentioned countless songs to him and he just breaks\n          them out without even needing to look at the music or hear the song.\n          If he doesn't know the song you're talking about, once he hears it he\n          usually can pick it up by ear.

As a UCLA music student, I can't\n          stress enough not only how incredibly talented he is just at playing\n          the guitar but the vast knowledge of guitar playing, guitar tone,\n          guitar \"tricks\", that really encompass all of the stuff a student\n          would yearn for in a lesson. And the direction of the lesson is\n          completely up to you, I've stopped Gabriel before and questioned him\n          on why he played something a certain way and he gives you a detailed\n          opinion on why he is doing it but also variations that might you suit\n          your playing better. Furthermore, with his extensive background in\n          music he can provide you with not only just the fundamentals and\n          mechanics of guitar playing but crafting songs, music theory, and the\n          structuring of soloing. Not to mention I think he's got every issue of\n          guitar player magazine dating back to the 80s.

I like Gabes guitar lesson approach that is without promising\n          instant success delusion to the student as well as parents. The time\n          and money invested into this guitar lessons was worth a lot to us as a\n          parent and to my son.We strongly recommend to anyone's kids to take\n          his classes. I shall say, \"Designed for beginners who want to play\n          Music/Guitar lessons quickly by ear.\"\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          <strong>\n            <em>-Joel & son Natan</em>\n          </strong>\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote className=\"student-testimonials-proper\">\n          Here is a fine guitar/music teacher...Gabe not only knows his craft on\n          a high level (playing) but canÂ communicate the how-to in a simple yet\n          meaningful way.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>\n          <strong>\n            <em>-Joy S.</em>\n          </strong>\n        </blockquote>\n        <blockquote className=\"student-testimonials-proper\">\n          I am so glad I found Gabe.
