In 2018, I received a surprise gift for four lessons with a guitar instructor nearby, The Lord of the Strings! I was anxious, nervous and shy. I couldn't name the strings on my guitar, I knew no chord shapes or any music theory at all. Early on, I made it clear to Gabe what my intentions were with guitar. It's a tertiary hobby that I love, but I can't commit an immense amount of time to, but I would be attending classes as consistently as possible and inform him when I was unable to attend or put in the expected time. Some months, I was hyper motivated to learn music and guitar theory, others I just brought in riffs or songs that I liked and wanted to learn. Gabe continuously supported my approach throughout the time. Since 2018, I have gone to see Gabe pretty much weekly. Given the time I've put into the hobby, my skill reflects the effort and Gabe has taught me many of my favorite guitar riffs and helped push my understanding of music further and further.
